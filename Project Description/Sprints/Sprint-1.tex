[28.1.25-08.02.25] 

\textbf{Roles/Responsibilities }

\begin{itemize}
    \item Marcus -> Wire-frames

    \item Mathias -> Â Create Doc-page

    \item Petter -> Initialize project, Establish sprint board
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expected Results} 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Fully Initialized Project:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The development environment is established and works as intended
    \item Repositories are configured and available for the rest of the team
    \item Base-filestructure is established, and the team has an understanding of the file organisation
\end{itemize}
\item Wireframes ready for review
\begin{itemize}
    \item Finished wireframes for the Homepage, booking-pages and login page. 
\end{itemize}
\item Comprehensive Documentation
\begin{itemize}
    \item An updated doc-page contains: \begin{itemize}
        \item Description of main demographic
        \item Product specification with focus on MVP
        \item A list of core functionalities which are going to be implemented
        \item A visualised or described processflow from userinteraction to booking
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\item Sprint Workflow established
\begin{itemize}
    \item Sprintboard is established with tasks assigned to the teammembers
    \item Clear rules for cooperation (Definition of Done, rules for codereviews and pull requests)
    \item Team has a defined workflow which can be used thoughout the project
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Risks and Challenges} 


\paragraph{1. \textbf{Project Initialization}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Team members may face issues setting up the development environment (e.g., dependency) conflicts, configuration errors).
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Ensuring all members have a consistent setup across different machines.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Provide detailed setup instructions and use a \verb|.env| file or Docker for uniform environments.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{2. \textbf{Wireframe Creation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Misalignment between the wireframes and stakeholders' expectations.
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Ensuring the wireframes are detailed enough to guide development but flexible enough for future changes.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Schedule a mid-sprint review session for early feedback on wireframes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{3. \textbf{Documentation}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Unclear or incomplete documentation, such as missing details on the demographic or MVP functionality.
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Balancing documentation detail with sprint timelines.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Assign a dedicated team member to oversee documentation quality and completeness.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{4. \textbf{Collaboration and Teamwork}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Miscommunication about task ownership or scope.
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Team members might not fully understand the "Definition of Done" or the code review process.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Conduct a kickoff meeting to clarify roles, expectations, and collaboration routines.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{5. \textbf{Time Management}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Overestimating the amount of work the team can complete within the sprint.
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Prioritizing tasks effectively and avoiding burnout or scope creep.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Focus on completing MVP-level tasks first and leave stretch goals as optional.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{6. \textbf{Sprint Board and Workflow Setup}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Poorly defined sprint board tasks may lead to ambiguity and delays.
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Ensuring tasks are granular enough to be actionable but not overly detailed.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Use templates for task creation and involve the team in breaking down larger tasks.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{7. \textbf{Team Alignment and Availability}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk:} Team members may have differing levels of experience or availability.
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Ensuring everyone stays productive and aligned.
    \item \textbf{Mitigation:} Schedule daily stand-ups to track progress and resolve blockers early.
\end{itemize}
