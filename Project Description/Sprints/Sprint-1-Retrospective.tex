\textbf{Sprint 1 - 28.01.25â€“08.02.25} 
\textbf{Sprint Reflection} 


Intended goals:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Wireframes for the respective pages of the web-application.
    \item Create Doc-page
    \item Initialize project
\item Establish sprint board and collaboration routines.
\end{itemize}

We achieved all our initial goals for the sprint. We also started on basic HTML for the web application based upon the wireframes created. 

Things we should maintain:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We divided tasks efficiently. For example, dividing the pages on the Wireframe and HTML.
    \item We set clear goals for the sprint.
    \item We put in (more than) sufficient time towards the project.
\end{itemize}

Things we could do differently:
\begin{itemize}
    \item We should have finished with individual assignments earlier, for the sake of using the acquired skills in the project.
    \item We should have tried including user feedback for the wireframes.
    \item The entire group should be maintaining the issue-board.
\end{itemize}
